kolam_shapes.py has functions for Kolam shapes.

rhombic_kolam.ipynb is a jupyter notebook for rhombic Kolam simulation.

square_kolam.ipynb is a jupyter notebook for Navagraha(3x3 square) Kolam simulation.

kolam sequences_abcd folder contains kolam sequences.

To simulate square (nxn) Kolams, run square_kolam.ipynb.

It will ask for number of dots. Enter 3 for Navagraha (3x3) Kolams.

![prompt_3x3_1](https://github.com/Bharathi-Tulasi/Kolam-Simulation/assets/121544324/85f00a20-4012-44cc-a20c-42b292b7e84d)

After entering 3, a dialog box will appear to select the required kolam sequence.

Select any Kolam from Navagraha sequences subfolder.

To simulate rhombic (1-n-1) Kolams, run rhombic_kolam.ipynb.

It will ask for number of dots. 

Enter 3 for 1-3-1 Kolams.

Enter 5 for 1-5-1 Kolams.

Enter 7 for 1-7-1 Kolams.

and so on.

After entering the number of dots, a dialog box will appear to select the required kolam sequence.

Select any Kolam from Rhombic kolam sequences subfolder which has separate 1-3-1, 1-5-1 and 1-7-1 kolam sequences subfolders.

**If there is a problem or error or jupyter notebook is showing loading, interrupt the kernel and run it again. It is a workaround as there is a problem with turtle library which is not solved by them yet.**
